Learning more about GitHub

My name is Freddy, a WordPress blogger by profession at https://vistamedia.xyz. I am working on an article for https://wpexplorer.com, which involves creating a static website using WordPress. During my research, I found Netlify, which allows you to host static websites, but I had to integrate the service with GitHub, which meant I had to learn about GitHub.

So far so good I am having a lot of fun. I can't wait to publish my first test site, and write all about it for you guys. If you have questions, please share openly. 

Cheers!
Freddy
